# CTF Development Repository

This repository contains materials and writeups for CTF challenges I've created and publicly released. This repository currently includes challenges from:
- USCGA AIM CTF 2022
- Nahamcon CTF 2024
- Nahamcon CTF 2025

## Organization

The challenges are organized into the following categories:
- Web
- Cryptography
- Forensics
- Reverse_engineering
- Scripting
- OSINT
- Misc

Each challenge has, at a minimum, a `challenge.txt` file with the original challenge prompt, the publicly available files for the challenge, and a writeup for how to solve it. Some challenges also have dockerfiles, challenge generation scripts, etc.

## All challenges

This is a list of all challenges in this repository, including their intended difficulty, which CTF they were in, and additional authors for collaborative challenges.
